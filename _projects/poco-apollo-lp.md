<p>
	Poco Apollo is an album by Icelandic musician Halldór Eldjárn. It is originally based on NASA’s archive from the Apollo space program. Halldór created a custom algorithm to determine the mood of each picture and turn it in to a generative ambient soundscape.
</p>
<p>
	This beautiful 12″ white vinyl, with cover art by designer Albert Muñoz, include four of these image soundscapes taken to the next level, in six tracks. Halldór has arranged the generated music for string players, synthesizers and added a layer of human touch to the tracks to produce a record that is a true collision of technology and art — representing one of mankind’s most technical and art inspiring endeavour to date.
