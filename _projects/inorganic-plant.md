A machine that acts and grows like a hanging plant. Equipped with a thermal printer and a light sensor, runs on electricity and is controlled by light. Each day, a few centimeters of plant are slowly printed out. The amount of light dictates how many and how big the leaves on the plant grow.

Plants are able to photosynthesize and grow if they get CO2, water, nutrition and sunlight. A houseplant needs constant care. You must make sure the soil is nutritious, that you water the plant correctly. The plant needs sunlight so it’s biological systems stay in tune.

Beautiful houseplants earn a place in our hearts with time. To keep them alive takes patience and effort. You won’t be able to grow a plant in one day, it takes weeks or even months. But we do enjoy the process of tending them, as they keep us aware of the now and remind us of the progress of life itself.

The plant is a part of our biological clock.

Introduce a new invention: A machine that acts and grows like a hanging plant. Equipped with a thermal printer and a light sensor, runs on electricity and is controlled by light. Each day, a few centimeters of the algorithmic plant are printed out, at a painstakingly slow speed. The amount of light dictates how many and how big the leaves on the plant grow.


Between days, a progress can be seen on the printout, as the light changes with day and night. The inorganic plant helps us understand time in longer intervals than minutes and hours, but at the same time logs the progress of life and light. It helps us understand days and weeks going by.
