Abstract
---
The idea of having a piece of software that augments the perfomance of a musician is a very interesting topic. What if software could help you coming up with new musical ideas, directly adapting to your creative flow in a nonintrusive manner? 

I present a set of non-intrusive audio and MIDI plugins that I created for Björk and Ólafur Arnalds, specifically for them to use when playing live. The plugins have been used by them in hundreds of concerts throughout the world.

Stratus is a realtime MIDI manipulator, based on Euclidian rhythms, made for Ólafur Arnalds to use with two self-playing pianos both live and in the studio.

Harmoslicer is an experimental approach to creating an "intelligent" vocal harmonizer for Björk, by storing buffers of live-sampled musical phrases and playing them back later dynamically, with slight harmonic variations.
