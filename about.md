My name is Halldór Eldjárn and I make music. I am in constant search of new ways to approach art with technology, interaction and creativity. 

On this page you can browse through some of the projects that I have created and collaborated in. Some of them are generative like [Poco Apollo](https://pocoapollo.hdor.is) where you can listen to music generated from photos of the moon, others are collaborative where you connect with other people to create art: [Paint Splatter](https://vimeo.com/156704713]), [STRATUS](https://stratuspianos.is) and some [mix old technology with new](https://vimeo.com/207629594).

If you want to get in touch, feel free to drop me a line at [halldor(at)eldjarn.is](mailto:halldor@eldjarn.is).
